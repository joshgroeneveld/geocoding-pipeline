# Does main geocoding-pipeline.py import other modules

# Review tables
# Will records with a blank address get identified as potential problems

# Will records without a number in the address get identified as a potential problem

# For records with errors, check inputs to update records
# Will a new address be inserted into the data frame

# Will a new lat long be inserted into the data frame

# Will a record to be removed get dropped from the data frame

# Will a set of geocoding results merge with input data

# Will a merged df concatenate with a df of known lat / long locations

# Will user input to verify results move files appropriately

# Will records to be verified identify records with a low match score

# Once verification is complete, will the unnecessary columns get dropped
