geocode_tables.py

A module that takes all of the reviewed tables, sends them through the geocoder,
joins the geocode outputs with the original inputs and exports to a new Excel file.

def main():
    print("Begin geocoding records")

# Create a directory to store the geocode outputs

# Create a directory to store the final Excel files

# For each table in <input_directory>, send all records through the geocoder

# Store the geocoded results in the geocode output directory and rename the
# output CSVs to match the input Excel files

# Load the input Excel files and the output geocoded CSVs into separate Pandas data frames

# Join the Excel data frame and the CSV data frame based on the input ID

# Output the joined data frame to a new Excel file in the final output directory
